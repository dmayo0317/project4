                    <p>Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that uses a decentralized system to verify and
                        maintain records of transactions. These facts make crypto almost impossible to counterfeit
                        or double spend. Crypto is based on blockchain technology. Blockchain is the system that
                        keeps the record of transactions maintained across several computers that are linked in
                        a peer-to-peer network. Basically, think about crypto as the digital equivalent to tickets
                        at a carnival to ride a Ferris wheel or play a game. Crypto can be either purchased online
                        or the coins can be “mined”. Mining crypto refers to solving complex mathematical problems
                        and being rewarded with either a coin or parts of a coin.

                    <h2 class="post-title">Cryptocurrency Timeline</h2>
                    <p>While crypto’s popularity has dramatically increased over the past ten years, it was actually
                        started in 1983 by David Chaum. Chaum created the first cryptocurrency called eCash. Although
                        the term cryptocurrency wasn’t coined until 1990, this first digital currency was similar to
                        today’s crypto because the transactions were anonymous and conducted over a public network. Of
                        course crypto did not become popular until 2008, when the value of gold and coins fell
                        dramatically. At this time was when an individual named Satoshi Nakamoto conducted the first
                        transaction with the most well-known cryptocurrency to this day: Bitcoin. Bitcoin soon
                        established itself as the ruler of cryptocurrency and its value skyrocketed to $10,000 in 2017.
                        In September of 2021, El Salvador made history and became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as
                        official currency.

                    <p>Let’s just say a lot. There are hundreds of types of crypto that are used in daily transactions.
                        These crypto’s include those made by everyday companies such as Tesla, Netflix or Google but
                        also include crypto created by individuals such as Dogecoin, Ethereum, or Solana. Even certain
                        countries are creating their own cryptos and establishing them as their own national currency.
                        This includes Venezuela with Petro, Dubai(UAE) with Emcash, and Estonia with Estcoin. Needless
                        to say that there are a huge number of cryptos on the market.
